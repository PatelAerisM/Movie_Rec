Tired of randomly choosing movies just over genres or actors , here I present a _really cool_  Movie Recommdation Engine.
Many times , we know a movie and it justs amazes us and we want to watch similar movies , so thats what you get._ ')
Select a movie , from a range of over 5000 movies , and we will give you top 10 recommendations , which you should definitely watch.
The algorithm is designed in such a way that those 10 movies will be the most apt recommendation , one can totally rely on.
So ,what are you waiting for ? Try it out!!

The movies dataset are imported using TMBD API, Wikipedia.
